# Burger-Challenge
This was one of the first challenges at the start of the Java Masterclass I'm in. I was supposed to create a system of classes using inheritance where needed and create functionality for choosing from a different type of burgers and additions. I decided to make it a bit more complex and created optional menus from which the operator can choose its options instead of using direct statements. The task was completed only using basic control statements and OOP because we haven't learned about Arrays and ArrayLists yet. Nevertheless, it was my first bigger project in the class so I decided to share it.
